# python program to demonstrate the operations that can be performed on lists

numbers1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]  # list of numbers
numbers2 = [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]  # list of numbers

# printing the list
print(numbers1 + numbers2)  # concatenation of two lists using '+' operator
print(numbers1 * 3)  # multiplication of list using '*' operator
print(numbers1[1:4])  # slicing of list using ':' operator
